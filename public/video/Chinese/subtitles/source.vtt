00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:03.580
okay, so this is a
test video.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:09.780
we're testing an ai
language model
that's able to
translate a video
into 70 different
languages.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:20.840
so down here for the
sake of the
prototype you'll
have five languages
that you'll be able
to switch between
and then the videos
should switch to a
different language.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.400
so this is a test
video.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.600
let's see how the
feature works out
within the 1st
version.
